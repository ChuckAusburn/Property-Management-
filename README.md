# Property-Management-

The client, a local rental property owner, has approximately 20 buildings which are managed by several property managers. 7 buildings are located on the Westside and the client does not have a website for tenants to submit maintenance and fix requests, currently these are handled via email and text. 

To provide better accountability and request tracking, the project team was tasked with creating an online maintenance request system that will allow the client to ensure timely processing of fix requests, tracking of issues by each building and 24/7 access to the request system. 

On the initial rollout, 7 of the 20 buildings will be entered into the system and configuration changes will be made per client request and viability. After a testing period and client acceptance, Phase 2 of the project will entail adding the remaing buildings to the application as well as enhanced functionality to garner feedback from the tenants regarding ease of use of the online system, promptness of service and a quick survey to gauge the efficiency of the application in getting the logged issues resolved.
